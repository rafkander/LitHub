<h2>Kzoo LitHub helps you save money</h2>
<p>Book stores can be expensive. Trading websites have shipping charges when you buy, fees and commissions when you sell. As a campus, we already have many of the book that we need for the next quarter. When we buy and sell to each other, we save money on charges, fees and commissions.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>When you find a book on Kzoo LitHub, you contact the seller and meet on-campus to trade the book. If a book is not available, you may "subscribe" to the book and receive a notification when becomes available.</p>
<p>Since the buyer and seller meet in person, <b>using Kzoo LitHub is completely free of cost</b>.</p>
