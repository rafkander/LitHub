<h3>Kzoo LitHub can help you save money</h3>
<p>Book stores can be expensive. Trading websites have shipping charges when you buy, fees and commissions when you sell. As a campus, we already have many of the book that we need for the next quarter. If we can buy and sell to each other, we can save a lot of money on charges, fees and commissions.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>When you find a book that you want to buy on Kzoo LitHub, you can contact the seller and meet on-campus to trade the book. If the book you are looking for is not available, you can subscribe to the book to receive notifications when that book is available.</p>
<p>Since the buyer and seller meet in person, <b>there are no charges, fees or commissions</b> from Kzoo LitHub.</p>
