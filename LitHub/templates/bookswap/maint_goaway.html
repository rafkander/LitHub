<h1>Open sesame?</h1>
<p>Sorry, if you had access to the top-secret page, you wouldn't be reading this.</p>
<h2>"So, what does this do?" I hear you ask.</h2>
<p>It's not all that confidential (after all, LitHub is open-source). This page lets those of us who run Kzoo LitHub mess with the knobs, buttons, and levers to check if everything is working properly. LitHub uses a few different technologies to give you all the awesome features that you love. LitHub finds books using Google Books, sends emails using an email service, lets you log in using Facebook, etc. This page automatically tests if everything is working properly.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please use the <a href="{% url bookswap.views.contact_us %}">contact page</a> to send us an email!</p>
