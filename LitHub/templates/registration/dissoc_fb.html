<h2>Disconnect your Facebook and LitHub accounts</h2>
<p>LitHub stores your Facebook id that it uses to identify you when you login using facebook. When you submit this form, that facebook id is deleted from our database. Your account will still be functional, but you will need to enter your username and password to log in.</p>
<p>Note: if you registered using Facebook, we have stored your primary email from facebook in our database also. Since an email address is required to have a LitHub account, we will not delete your email from our database. You are free to delete your LitHub account if you prefer not to have your email address in our database.</p>
